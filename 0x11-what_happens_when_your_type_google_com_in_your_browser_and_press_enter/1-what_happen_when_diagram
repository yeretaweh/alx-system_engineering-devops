Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the flow:
DNS Lookup: The user types https://www.google.com into their browser. The browser doesn't know the IP address of google.com, so it asks a local DNS resolver for help. The local DNS resolver checks its cache to see if it already knows the IP address. If it doesn't, it initiates a recursive query to find the IP address.
Root Nameserver: The local DNS resolver queries a root nameserver. The root nameserver doesn't know the IP address of google.com, but it knows the location of the TLD nameserver for .com domains.
TLD Nameserver: The local DNS resolver queries the TLD nameserver for .com domains. The TLD nameserver knows the location of the authoritative nameserver for google.com.
Authoritative Nameserver: The local DNS resolver queries the authoritative nameserver for google.com. The authoritative nameserver responds with the IP address of google.com.
HTTPS Request: The browser now knows the IP address of google.com and can send an HTTPS request to the server on port 443 (the standard port for HTTPS).
Firewall: The request first passes through a firewall that filters out malicious traffic.
Load Balancer: The request is then routed by a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across multiple web servers.
Web Server: A web server receives the request and processes it to generate an HTML response.
Application Server (optional): In some cases, the web server might hand
